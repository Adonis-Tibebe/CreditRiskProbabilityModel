# Notebooks

This directory contains Jupyter notebooks for:

- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
- **Feature Engineering**
- **Model Training and Evaluation**
- **Testing and Experimentation**

## Structure

- `EDA_analysis.ipynb`: Detailed exploratory analysis of the data, including structure, distribution of key categorical and numerical columns, and initial insights.
- `feature_engineering.ipynb`: Steps and logic for feature creation, transformation, and selection.
- `model_training.ipynb`: Scripts for training, validating, and evaluating machine learning models.
- `tests.ipynb`: Interactive notebook for testing model predictions, preprocessing, and API integration.

## Usage

1. Open any notebook in this directory with JupyterLab, Jupyter Notebook, or VS Code.
2. Follow the instructions and code cells to reproduce the analysis or experiments.
3. Use `tests.ipynb` to interactively test model predictions and API endpoints.

## Notes

- Notebooks are intended for experimentation and documentation of the data science workflow.
- For production code, refer to the `src/` directory.
- Data files referenced in notebooks are stored in the `data/` directory and tracked with DVC.
